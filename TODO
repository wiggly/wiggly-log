- do something about property files class, this could do with being seperate
  from logging since we're using it in the games as well...

- replace std::map with a hashmap implementation where it makes sense.

- add some proper regression tests


- add some initial timing tests to compare the straight message and stream
logging methods.


- think about how to have arbitrary logging levels while retaining the MACRO
facility


- think about how to provide MACRO logging using templates, perhaps this
would allow us to use arbitrary logging levels as long as they all evaluated
to an integral value


- add more doxygen documentation


- create a fast and flexible log format class


- make logging optionally thread-safe
